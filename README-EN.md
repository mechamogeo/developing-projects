## Developing Projects

This repository contains a list of projects I'm planning to develop in the near future.

## Projects

1. **Programming Battleship**: A game inspired by the classic Battleship game, but designed to test programmers' skills. The game will consist of two teams competing against each other and will include various communication protocols, gamification rules, and survival detection. [[Batalha Naval para Programadores]]

2. **Stock Market Simulator**: A stock market simulator that will allow users to simulate buying and selling stocks in real-time. The simulator will use real stock market data to make the experience as realistic as possible.

3. **Virtual Library**: A web application that will allow users to search and read books online. The library will contain a large collection of books from various genres and authors. The application will also allow users to create an account, save books to their reading list, and track their reading progress.
